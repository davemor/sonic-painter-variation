#Sonic Painter Variation
This is a variation of the Sonic Painter example created for [Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps](https://class.coursera.org/digitalmedia-002) on Coursera. The project uses the Maxim audio library but I ended up going down my own track a bit so there isn't any of the example code left.  I have posted a [video](https://vimeo.com/100040747) of it running to Vimeo.

##Requirements
To run the program you will need to download [Processing](http://www.processing.org).  Then just open the sketch.
