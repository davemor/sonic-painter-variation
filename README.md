#Sonic Painter Variation
This is a variation of the Sonic Painter example created for Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps on Coursera. The project uses the Maxim audio library but other then that no longer shares any code with the example programs.

##Requirements
To run the program you will need to download [Processing](http://www.processing.org).  Then just open the sketch.
